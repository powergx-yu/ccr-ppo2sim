# Walkthrough: UI Refinements & PWA Update

I have completed several UI enhancements and logic refinements to make the simulator more professional and accessible to international users.

## Key Changes

### 1. Relocated & Restyled Install Button
The **PWA Install** button has been moved from the right-side audio control panel to the top-left, next to the main title. It now features a more subtle blue-outline design that blends better with the overall aesthetic.

### 2. Trilingual Installation Instructions
Clicking the "Install" button now triggers a clean, simplified instruction popup in three languages:
- **English**
- **Japanese (日本語)**
- **Chinese (中文)**

It provides specific steps for both **Android (Chrome)** and **iOS/iPad (Safari)** users.

### 3. Company Logo Integration
Added the `PowergxIcon.png` logo to the header. It is designed to bridge across both lines of the title for a more integrated, premium look.

### 4. Cleanup
Removed the "SYSTEM UPDATED" toast notification from the bottom-right corner as requested to reduce visual clutter.

## How to Update GitHub

Since your local folder is not currently linked to GitHub via Git, you can update your site by repeating the web upload process:

1. Open your repository: [github.com/yushouman-ai/ccr-ppo2sim](https://github.com/yushouman-ai/ccr-ppo2sim)
2. Click **Add file** -> **Upload files**.
3. Drag and drop these files from your computer:
   - `index.html`
   - `PowergxIcon.png`
4. Scroll down, enter a message like "Update UI and icons", and click **Commit changes**.

Your GitHub Pages site will automatically update within a few minutes!
