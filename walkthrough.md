# Walkthrough: UI Refinements, Responsive Layout & GitHub Optimization

I have completed the final refinements to the CCR PPO2 Simulator, ensuring it looks elite on all devices and maintains a clean, professional GitHub repository.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Responsive "Pro" Layout
- **iPad & Tablets**: Optimized the layout for larger screens. The HUD (PPO2, Depth) now scales up automatically when the screen width is above 700px, creating much better legibility.
- **Landscape Support**: Fixed issues where iPad landscape mode would look cramped.
- **Mobile Rescue**: Implemented a responsive header for narrow mobile screens to prevent element overlap and maintain order.

### 2. Logo & Asset Stabilization
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Standardized the company logo filename to all-lowercase (`powergxicon.png`) to fix loading issues on Linux-based servers (GitHub).
- **Cache Busting**: Added versioning (`?v=2`) to the logo to force browsers (especially stubborn ones like QQ Browser) to refresh their cache and show the latest icon.

### 3. PWA & Internationalization
- **Trilingual Instructions**: Simplified installation guide in English, Japanese, and Chinese.
- **Installation Guard**: Added `translate="no"` to the "Install" button to prevent browsers from corrupting the UI with automatic translations.

### 4. Repository Governance
- **Repository Cleanup**: Removed all old test files, backups, and unnecessary ZIP files.
- **Git Sync**: Successfully linked the project to the new GitHub home: `https://github.com/powergx-yu/ccr-ppo2sim.git`.
